Certainly, here's an edited and proofread version:
I was thrilled to have the opportunity to discuss the evolution and origins, as well as the future development of AI, with Aidan Meller, the creator of A.i Da, during a conversation about the record-breaking sale of over a million dollars worth of AI art at Sotheby's. We also touched upon some rare PDF files of Turing's sketches. During our chat, Aidan shared that during their trip to Egypt, his robot was widely publicized as a spy, making headlines in major news outlets. He also mentioned that by 2030, AI is expected to take over all jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg may be creating a web 3 metaverse. I was fascinated to learn about the emergence of Deepseek, which occurred shortly after the sale in 2025, and Aidan shared that he thought it was a significant breakthrough, albeit a bit alarming due to its low budget. I jokingly asked Aidan if he would be interested in trading paintings with me, and he laughed, explaining that the team is very cautious about where the art goes. It was an interesting conversation, and I had the chance to showcase some of my own artwork. We also discussed the potential dangers of AI and the recent signing of a petition by 3,000 artists against the sale of AI art. Aidan replied that he is not interested in defending the sales or the art itself, but rather, he is focused on creating it. Overall, it was a fascinating discussion, and I learned a lot.
